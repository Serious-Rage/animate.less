{"body":"Animate.less\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe following description is from the original project. I'll update the readme soon.\r\n\r\n*Just-add-water CSS animation*\r\n\r\n`animate.css` is a bunch of cool, fun, and cross-browser animations for you to use in your projects. Great for emphasis, home pages, sliders, and general just-add-water-awesomeness.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nTo use animate.css in your website, simply drop the stylesheet into your document's `<head>`, and add the class `animated` to an element, along with any of the animation names. That's it! You've got a CSS animated element. Super!\r\n\r\nYou can do a whole bunch of other stuff with animate.css when you combine it with jQuery or add your own CSS rules. Dynamically add animations using jQuery with ease:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$('#yourElement').addClass('animated bounceOutLeft');\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can change the duration of your animations, add a delay or change the number of times that it plays!\r\n\r\n```\r\n#yourElement {\r\n\t-vendor-animation-duration: 3s;\r\n\t-vendor-animation-delay: 2s;\r\n\t-vendor-animation-iteration-count: infinite;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Note: be sure to replace \"vendor\" in the CSS with the applicable vendor prefixes (webkit, moz, ms, o)*\r\n\r\n##License\r\nAnimate.css is licensed under the &#9786; license.
